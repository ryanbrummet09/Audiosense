dataExtractCode contains code that is used to extract code from the raw data
file.  It also contains code to remove 50 values, samples that are not a 
certain percentage in length of the average duration of a survey for each
user, and all samples for users that have less than 20 samples.

evalCode contains code that is used to compare groups of data samples (t test,
etc)

mappingCode contains code that is used to map attributes onto a single
attribute

misc contains old code that was used for different functions up until the code
was formalized

normalizationCode contains code that is used to normalize data.



As of right now there is only one main code function (in the main directory)
named audioSurveyProc.m.  This function will extract the data, normalize it,
and map attributes onto a single value.  The function has the following form

[extractedData, combinedData, mappingError, mappingCoefficients] = 
audioSurveyProc( targetFileName, removeFiftyVals, minSurveyPercent,
omitNotListening, omitListening, omitNotUserInit, omitUserInit, 
normalizeMethod, mapScore, mapPerUser, stratifySampling, reSample,
attrMapTarget, polyFitDegree, medianTrueMeanFalse)

For in depth detail on each param, read the comments in the audioSurveyProc.m
file

extractedData - extractedData from raw data file (possibly normalized)

combinedData - extractedData from raw data file with attributes combined to
	single score.

mappingError - gives the absolute value of the difference between the mapping
	error of the testing and training sets.  Gives a notion of how effect
	the mapping is.

mappingCoefficients - gives the coefficients that are used to map attributes
	onto anther attribute (we use a polynomial)

targetFileName - string, name of the raw data file

removeFiftyVals - bool, whether or not to remove fifty vals

minSurveyPercent - int, gives the percent of the average duration (per user)
	that a survey duration must be

omitNotListening - bool, whether or not to omit samples where the user wasn't 
	listening

omitListening - bool, whether or not to omit samples where the user was
	listen

omitNotUserInit - bool, whether or not to omit samples where the user did
	not initiate the survey

omitUserInit - bool, whether or not to omit samples where the user initiated
	the survey

normalizeMethod - int, 1 for global normalization, 2 for normalization by
	user, any other number for not normalization

mapScore - bool, whether or not to map onto one attribute

mapPerUser - bool, whehter or not to map onto one attribute per user

stratifySampling - bool, when producing testing and training sets for the 
	mapping function whether or to produce the two sets by using
	stratification

reSample - bool, when producing testing and training sets for the mapping
	function whether or not to re-sample users so that each set have the
	same number of sample from each user

attrMapTarget - int, gives the attribute that all other attributes are mapped
	to: 1 for sp, 2 for le, 3 for ld, 4 for ld2, 5 for lcl, 6 for ap,
	7 for qol, 8 for im, 9 for st

polyFitDegree - int, gives the degree of the polynomial for the attribute
	mapping

medianTrueMeanFalse - bool, if true attributes are combined by picking the 
	median, if false by finding the mean
