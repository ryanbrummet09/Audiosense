To run you must have the CATSTRUCT library.  You can find it at 
http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/7842-catstruct.

Each of the included functions have detailed comments explaining their
use so this Readme exists to explain what each function does, not how 
to use them.

use shabihPatchFunc to create preprocessed datasets for each response.
This function assumes that you have already extracted the data with 
Shabih's script.

removeNonQualUsers is used by shabihPatchFunc and thus should not be
individually used.

use SVMFunc to create SVM models for the given response with cross
validation.  NOTICE THAT SVMfunc WILL USE ALL PREDICTORS IN DATASETS
THAT ARE PASSED TO IT.  IF YOU WISH TO INCLUDE ONLY CERTAIN PREDICTORS
YOU MUST DO ADDITIONAL PROCESSING TO REMOVE THEM.  This is as simple as
removing relevent columns from the datasets produced by shabihPatchFunc.

produceIndvSets is used to extract the relevent folds that are created
when SVMFunc is used (duplicates the statification done by SVMFunc).

The example scripts exist to show how one might use shabihPatchFunc
and SVMFunc.
