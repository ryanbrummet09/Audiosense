%currentSampleCountTraining (input matrix): gives the number of
%       samples from each user that are in the training set thus far.  The
%       input is a matrix of zeros with patient id's only.

%currentSampleCountTesting (input matrix): gives the number of 
%       samples from each user that are int the testing set thus far.  The
%       input is a matrix of zeros with patient id's only.

%currentSampleTrainingIndexes (input matrix): gives the index of each
%       sample in the overall patient data matrix for each user sample in 
%       the training set. the input is a matrix of zeros.

%currentSampleTestingIndexes (input matrix): gives the index of each
%       sample in the overall patient data matrix for each user sample in
%       the testing set.  The input is a matrix of zeros.

%inputData (input matrix): gives the overall patient data matrix

%userSampleCount (input matrix): used to determine the number of users there
%       are in the overall patient data matrix without searching through
%       the whole matrix

%trainingSet (input/output 3dArray): subset of the overall patient data matrix
%       that will be used as a training set to map attributes

%testingSet (input/output 3dArray): subset of the overall patient data matrix that
%       will be used as a testing set for the attribute mappings
