This is a readme for running the 'perFilePipeline.m'. There are three arguments that go into the perFilePipeline function, these are the number of mfcc's, the sampling frequency of the audio (in our case 16000), the path to the audio file.

Usage:
[featureVector] = perFilePipeline(12,16000,'/Volumes/DummyExternalDrive/DummyFolder/patient-EMA999.9.99.2014-01-01 00-00-00.audio');
